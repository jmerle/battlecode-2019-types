# Battlecode 2019 Types

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jmerle/battlecode-2019-types.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jmerle/battlecode-2019-types)

TypeScript declarations for MIT's [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) 2019.

Automatically generated documentation can be found [here](http://jmerle.github.io/battlecode-2019-types/).

## Usage

Simply drop the `battlecode.d.ts` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/jmerle/battlecode-2019-types/releases) into your project.

Note that the package isn't available from [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped). This is because it can take about 7 days to get typings for a new package into the DefinitelyTyped repository, which isn't favorable in a contest that'll only take a month.
